DESCRIPTION
       Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols
       to attack. New modules are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and
       very fast.

       This tool gives researchers and security consultants the possibility to
       show  how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a
       system.
 Currently this tool supports:
        adam6500 afp asterisk cisco cisco-enable cvs firebird ftp ftps
        http[s]-{head|get|post} http[s]-{get|post}-form http-proxy
        http-proxy-urlenum icq imap[s] irc ldap2[s]
        ldap3[-{cram|digest}md5][s] mssql mysql(v4) mysql5 ncp nntp
        oracle oracle-listener oracle-sid pcanywhere pcnfs pop3[s]
        postgres rdp redis rexec rlogin rpcap rsh rtsp s7-300 sapr3 sip
        smb smtp[s] smtp-enum snmp socks5 ssh sshkey svn teamspeak telnet[s]
        vmauthd vnc xmpp

        For most protocols SSL is supported (e.g. https-get, ftp-ssl, etc.)

If not all necessary libraries are found during compile time, your
        available services will be less.
        Type "hydra" to see what is available.

Options
       target a target to attack, can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address or  DNS
              name.

       service
              a service to attack, see the list of protocols available

OPTIONAL SERVICE PARAMETER
              Some  modules have optional or mandatory options. type "hydra -U
              <servicename>"
               to get help on on the options of a service.

       -R     restore a previously aborted session. Requires  a  hydra.restore
              file  was  written.  Options are restored, but can be changed by
              setting them after -R on the command line

       -S     connect via SSL

       -O     use old SSL v2 and v3

       -s PORT
              if the service is on a different default port, define it here

       -l LOGIN
              or -L FILE login with LOGIN name, or load  several  logins  from
              FILE

       -p PASS
              or  -P  FILE  try  password PASS, or load several passwords from
              FILE
  -x min:max:charset
              generate passwords from min to max length. charset can contain 1
               for numbers, a for lowcase and A for upcase characters.
               Any other character is added is put to the list.
                 Example: 1:2:a1%.
                 The generated passwords will be of length 1 to 2 and contain
                 lowcase letters, numbers and/or percent signs and dots.

       -y     disable use of symbols in -x bruteforce, see above

       -e nsr additional checks, "n" for null password, "s" try login as pass,
              "r" try the reverse login as pass

       -C FILE
              colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of -L/-P options

       -u     by  default  Hydra  checks  all passwords for one login and then
              tries the next login. This option loops around the passwords, so
              the  first  password is tried on all logins, then the next pass\u2010
              word.

 -f     exit after the first found login/password pair (per host if -M)

       -F     exit after the first found login/password pair for any host (for
              usage with -M)

       -M FILE
              server list for parallel attacks, one entry per line

       -o FILE
              write found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout

       -b FORMAT
              specify the format for the -o FILE: text(default), json, jsonv1

       -t TASKS
              run TASKS number of connects in parallel (default: 16)

       -m OPTIONS
              module  specific options. See hydra -U <module> what options are
              available.

       -w TIME
              defines the max wait time in seconds for responses (default: 32)

 -W TIME
              defines a wait time between each  connection  a  task  performs.
              This usually only makes sense if a low task number is used, .e.g
              -t 1

       -c TIME
              the wait time in seconds per login attempt over all threads  (-t
              1  is  recommended)  This usually only makes sense if a low task
              number is used, .e.g -t 1

       -4 / -6
              prefer IPv4 (default) or IPv6 addresses

       -v / -V
              verbose mode / show login+pass combination for each attempt

       -d     debug mode

       -I     ignore an existing restore file (don't wait 10 seconds)

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.
