What is BeEF?
BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser.

A Mid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against clients, including mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context.

Source
------

Obtain application source code either by downloading the latest archive:

  $ wget https://github.com/beefproject/beef/archive/master.zip

Or cloning the Git repository from Github:

  $ git clone https://github.com/beefproject/beef


Prerequisites
--------------

BeEF requires Ruby 2.7+.

If your operating system package manager does not support Ruby version 2.7,
you can add the brightbox ppa repository for the latest version of Ruby:

  $ sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng

Alternatively, consider using a Ruby environment manager such as rbenv or rvm
to manager your Ruby versions. Refer to the following for more information:

  * rbenv: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv
  * rvm: https://rvm.io/rvm/install


Installation
------------

Once Ruby is installed, run the install script in the BeEF directory:

  ./install

This script installs the required operating system packages and all the
prerequisite Ruby gems.

Upon successful installation, be sure to read the Configuration page
on the wiki for important details on configuring and securing BeEF.

Start BeEF
----------

To start BeEF, simply run:

  $ ./beef


Updating
--------

Due to the fast-paced nature of web browser development and webappsec landscape,
it's best to regularly update BeEF to the latest version.

If you're using BeEF from the GitHub repository, updating is as simple as:

  $ ./update-beef

Or pull the latest repo yourself and then update the gems with:
  
  $ git pull
  
  $ bundle
