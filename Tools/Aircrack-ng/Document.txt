aircrack-ng - 802.11 WEP / WPA-PSK key cracker

Synopsis
aircrack-ng [options] <.cap / .ivs file(s)>

Description
aircrack-ng is a 802.11 WEP / WPA-PSK key cracker. It implements the so-called Fluhrer - Mantin - Shamir (FMS) attack, along with some
new attacks by a talented hacker named KoreK. When enough encrypted packets have been gathered, aircrack-ng can almost instantly
recover the WEP key.

Options
-H, --help
Shows the help screen.

Common options:
-a <amode>
Force the attack mode, 1 or wep for WEP and 2 or wpa for WPA-PSK.
-e <essid>
Select the target network based on the ESSID. This option is also required for WPA cracking if the SSID is cloacked.
-b <bssid>
Select the target network based on the access point MAC address.
-p <nbcpu>
Set this option to the number of CPUs to use (only available on SMP systems). By default, it uses all available CPUs
-q
If set, no status information is displayed.
Static WEP cracking options:
-c
Search alpha-numeric characters only.
-t
Search binary coded decimal characters only.
-h
Search the numeric key for Fritz!BOX
-d <mask>
Specify mask of the key. For example: A1:XX:CF
-m <maddr>
Only keep the IVs coming from packets that match this MAC address. Alternatively, use -m ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff to use all and every IVs,
regardless of the network (this disables ESSID and BSSID filtering).
-n <nbits>
Specify the length of the key: 64 for 40-bit WEP, 128 for 104-bit WEP, etc., until 512 bits of length. The default value is 128.
-i <index>
Only keep the IVs that have this key index (1 to 4). The default behaviour is to ignore the key index in the packet, and use the IV
regardless.
-f <fudge>
By default, this parameter is set to 2. Use a higher value to increase the bruteforce level: cracking will take more time, but with a
higher likelihood of success.
-k <korek>
There are 17 KoreK attacks. Sometimes one attack creates a huge false positive that prevents the key from being found, even with lots
of IVs. Try -k 1, -k 2, ... -k 17 to disable each attack selectively.
-x or -x0
Disable last keybytes bruteforce (not advised).
-x1
Enable last keybyte bruteforcing (default)
-x2
Enable last two keybytes bruteforcing.
-X
Disable bruteforce multithreading (SMP only).
-s
Shows ASCII version of the key at the right of the screen
-y
This is an experimental single brute-force attack which should only be used when the standard attack mode fails with more than one million IVs.
-z
Uses PTW (Andrei Pyshkin, Erik Tews and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann) attack.
WPA-PSK cracking options:
-w <words>
Path to a dictionary file for wpa cracking. Specify "-" to use stdin.
