# Hashcat

Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting five unique modes of attack for over 300 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. hashcat currently supports CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and has facilities to help enable distributed password cracking.

Hashcat supports five unique modes of attack for over 300 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. hashcat currently supports CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators on Linux, and has facilities to help enable distributed password cracking.

Hashcat offers multiple attack modes for obtaining effective and complex coverage over a hash’s keyspace. These modes are:

 - Brute-Force attack
 - Combinator attack
 - Dictionary attack
 - Fingerprint attack
 - Hybrid attack
 - Mask attack
 - Permutation attack
 - Rule-based attack
 - Table-Lookup attack
 - Toggle-Case attack
 - PRINCE attack

# Documentation

## Hashcat Suite
Beyond hashcat itself, there are other useful utilities from the same team, maintained in separate repositories.

 - hashcat - World's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility
 - hashcat-utils - Small utilities that are useful in advanced password cracking
 - maskprocessor - High-performance word generator with a per-position configureable charset
 - statsprocessor - Word generator based on per-position markov-chains
 - princeprocessor - Standalone password candidate generator using the PRINCE algorithm
 - kwprocessor - Advanced keyboard-walk generator with configureable basechars, keymap and routes

## Flags Used 
 - ```-m``` is used for denoting the hash mode that is for choosing which hashing format to break
 - ```-a``` is used for attack mode.

## Core Attack Modes
 - Dictionary attack - trying all words in a list; also called “straight” mode (attack mode 0, ```-a 0``` )
 - Combinator attack - concatenating words from multiple wordlists ```(-a 1)```
 - Brute-force attack and Mask attack - trying all characters from given charsets, per position ```(-a 3)```
 - Hybrid attack - combining wordlists+masks ```(-a 6)``` and masks+wordlists ```(-a 7)```; can also be done with rules
 - Association attack - use an username, a filename, a hint, or any other pieces of information which could have had an influence in the password generation to attack one specific hash ```(-a 9)```
 - Rule-based attack - applying rules to words from wordlists; combines with wordlist-based attacks (attack modes ```0, 6, and 7```)
 - Toggle-case attack - toggling case of characters; now accomplished with rules

## Usage

<img src="./Image/ray-so-export.png">

Hashcat comes pre-installed with a Kali Linux and it is multi-threaded so benchmark your system by using following command:
```bash
   $ hashcat -b
```

The following is the implementation of the command for benchmarking :

<img src="./Image/benchmark hashcat.png">

Here we can get an idea about the performance of our system. Let's run this tool to crack some hashes. Here we have collected some hashed on a text file.

<img src="./Image/hashes.png">

Now we can crack these using Hashcat, and store the output in a craced.txt file by applying following command:

```bash 
    $ hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt /usr/share/seclists/Passwords
Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt

```

The command used here is -m flag to specify the hash type, ```-a``` for attack mode and ```-o``` for output file, here we named our output file ```cracked.txt```, then we give the target hash file to crack named ```hashes.txt```, at last we specify the wordlist file to be used. In the following screenshot we can see that hashcat the cracking.

The cracked ```hashes.txt``` is as follows:

Thus hashcat can be thus be used to crack potential hashes of passwords and can help in cracking passwords.
