-------------------------------------
         WHAT IS AMASS
-------------------------------------
 This package contains a tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and perform external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.

Information Gathering Techniques Used: - DNS: Basic enumeration, Brute forcing (upon request), Reverse DNS sweeping, Subdomain name alterations/permutations, Zone transfers (upon request) - Scraping: Ask, Baidu, Bing, DNSDumpster, DNSTable, Dogpile, Exalead, Google, HackerOne, IPv4Info, Netcraft, PTRArchive, Riddler, SiteDossier, ViewDNS, Yahoo - Certificates: Active pulls (upon request), Censys, CertSpotter, Crtsh, Entrust, GoogleCT - APIs: AlienVault, BinaryEdge, BufferOver, CIRCL, CommonCrawl, DNSDB, HackerTarget, Mnemonic, NetworksDB, PassiveTotal, RADb, Robtex, SecurityTrails, ShadowServer, Shodan, Spyse (CertDB & FindSubdomains), Sublist3rAPI, TeamCymru, ThreatCrowd, Twitter, Umbrella, URLScan, VirusTotal - Web Archives: ArchiveIt, ArchiveToday, Arquivo, LoCArchive, OpenUKArchive, UKGovArchive, Wayback


HOW TO INSTALL

Open Terminal
```
     
   sudo apt update

   sudo apt upgrade

   sudo apt install amass
```

HOW TO USE


## Simple Examples For Getting Started

The amass tool and all the subcommands show options using the **'-h'** and **'-help'** flags:

```bash
amass -help
```

Check the version by performing the following:

```bash
amass -version
```

The most basic use of the tool for subdomain enumeration:

```bash
amass enum -d example.com
```

Typical parameters for DNS enumeration:

```bash
$ amass enum -brute -min-for-recursive 2 -d example.com
example.com (FQDN) --> node --> www.example.com (FQDN)
www.example.com (FQDN) --> a_record --> 123.456.789.01 (IPAddress)
...
```

Executing the tool via the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ caffix/amass:latest enum --list
```

The volume argument allows the Amass graph database to persist between executions and output files to be accessed on the host system. The first field (left of the colon) of the volume option is the amass output directory that is external to Docker, while the second field is the path, internal to Docker, where amass will write the output files.

## Command-line Usage Information

The amass tool has several subcommands shown below for handling your Internet exposure investigation.

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| intel | Collect open source intelligence for investigation of the target organization |
| enum | Perform DNS enumeration and network mapping of systems exposed to the Internet |
| db | Manage the graph databases storing the enumeration results |

All subcommands have some default global arguments that can be seen below.

| Flag | Description | Example |

### The 'enum' Subcommand

This subcommand will perform DNS enumeration and network mapping while populating the selected graph database. All the setting available in the configuration file are relevant to this subcommand. The following flags are available for configuration:

#### Mode description

+ **Normal**: Run enum subcommand without specifing active or passive flag will seed the enumeration from data sources and leverage DNS to validate findings and further investigate the namespaces in scope (provided domain names)

  `amass enum -d example.com`

+ **Active**: It will perform all of the Normal mode and reach out to the discovered assets and attempt to obtain TLS certificates, perform DNS zone transfers, use NSEC walking, and perform web crawling.

  `amass enum -active -d example.com -p 80,443,8080`

+ **Passive**: It will only obtain information from data sources and blindly accept it.

  `amass enum --passive -d example.com`

## The Output Directory

Amass has several files that it outputs during an enumeration (e.g. the log file). If you are not using a database server to store the network graph information, then Amass creates a file based graph database in the output directory. These files are used again during future enumerations.

By default, the output directory is created in the operating system default root directory to use for user-specific configuration data and named *amass*. If this is not suitable for your needs, then the subcommands can be instructed to create the output directory in an alternative location using the **'-dir'** flag.

If you decide to use an Amass configuration file, it will be automatically discovered when put in the output directory and named **config.yaml**.

## The Configuration File

Configuration files are provided so users can specify the scope and options with Amass. 

API keys for data sources are stored in a separate file. 

The location of the configuration file can be specified using the `-config` flag or the `AMASS_CONFIG` environment variable.

Amass automatically tries to discover the configuration file (named `config.yaml`) in the following locations:

| Operating System | Path |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Linux / Unix | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/amass/config.yaml` or `$HOME/.config/amass/config.yaml` or `/etc/amass/config.yaml` |
| Windows | `%AppData%\amass\config.yaml` |
| OSX | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/amass/config.yaml` |

These are good places for you to put your configuration file.

Note that these locations are based on the [output directory](#the-output-directory). If you use the `-dir` flag, the location where Amass will try to discover the configuration file will change. For example, if you pass in `-dir ./my-out-dir`, Amass will try to discover a configuration file in `./my-out-dir/config.yaml`.

## The Graph Database

All Amass enumeration findings are stored in a graph database. This database is either located in a single file within the output directory or connected to remotely using settings provided by the configuration file.

When a new enumeration begins and a graph database already exists with previous findings for the same target(s), the subdomain names from those previous enumerations are utilized in the new enumeration. New DNS queries are performed against those subdomain names to ensure that they are still legitimate and to obtain current IP addresses.

There is nothing preventing multiple users from sharing a single (remote) graph database and leveraging each others findings across enumerations.

### Setting up PostgreSQL for OWASP Amass

Once you have the postgres server running on your machine and access to the psql tool, execute the follow two commands to initialize your amass database:

```bash
psql postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/ -c "CREATE DATABASE assetdb"
psql postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/ -c "ALTER DATABASE assetdb SET TIMEZONE to 'UTC'"
```

Now you can add the following setting into your Amass `config.yaml` file for storing and analyzing attack surface discoveries using PostgreSQL:

```yaml
options:
  database: "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/assetdb?testing=works"
```
