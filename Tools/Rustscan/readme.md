## Usage

### Working with RustScan Tool on Kali Linux OS

**Example 1: Host Scanning**

_we will be performing a simple port scan on the domain._

```
rustscan -a testphp.vulnweb.com
```
**Example 2: Individual Port Scanning**

_we will be performing specific single port detection rather than scanning all the ports._

```
rustscan -a testphp.vulnweb.com -p 443
```

**Example 3: Multiple selected port scanning**

_we will be performing multiple port scans or specific lists of ports rather than scanning all the ports._

```
rustscan -a testphp.vulnweb.com -p 443,80,121,65535
```
**Example 4: Ranges of ports**

_we will be performing detection of ports from the range of 1-1000 on the domain._
```
rustscan -a testphp.vulnweb.com --range 1-1000
```
