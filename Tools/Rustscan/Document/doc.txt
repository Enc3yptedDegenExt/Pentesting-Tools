# RustScan

## Why Rustscan?
RustScan is a modern take on the port scanner. Sleek & fast. All while providing extensive extendability to you.

Not to mention RustScan uses Adaptive Learning to improve itself over time, making it the best port scanner for you.

### some features: 

- Scans all 65k ports in 3 seconds.
- Full scripting engine support. Automatically pipe results into Nmap, or use our scripts (or write your own) to do whatever you want.
- Adaptive learning. RustScan improves the more you use it. No bloated machine learning here, just basic maths.
- The usuals you would expect. IPv6, CIDR, file input and more.
- Automatically pipes ports into Nmap.
