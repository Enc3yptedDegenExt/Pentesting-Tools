DNSRecon
        DNSRecon, as it is known today, is the Python equivalent of a Ruby script originally written by Carlos Perez toward the end of 2006. In his own words, this tool largely emerged from his personal need to reflect DNS-related data collection in an intuitive manner while the Python version allowed him to practice his newly acquired skills with the programming language.

DNSRecon can perform a variety of functions ranging from security assessments to basic network troubleshooting by allowing users to:

- Check DNS server cache records for A, AAAA, and CNAME records given a list of host records in a text file
- Enumerate general DNS records for a given domain (MX, SOA, NS, A, AAAA, SPF, and TXT)
- Check all NS records for zone transfers
- Check for wildcard resolution
- Perform common SRV record enumeration and top-level domain (TLD) expansion
- Check brute force subdomain and host A and AAAA records given a domain and a wordlist
- Perform a PTR record lookup for a given IP range or CIDR
- Perform subdomain and host enumeration via Google Dorks
- Present findings in text file format for easy manipulation
