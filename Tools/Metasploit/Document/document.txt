                                                           **DESCRIPTION** 
  
  
Metasploit is a powerful open-source penetration testing framework that provides a wide range of tools and resources for exploiting vulnerabilities, 
developing custom exploits, automating tasks, and performing post-exploitation activities. Metasploit is included by default in Kali Linux, 
a popular Linux distribution for penetration testing and security research.

                                              **How to use Metasploit on Kali Linux**

Getting started with Metasploit on Kali Linux

To start using Metasploit on Kali Linux, open a terminal and navigate to the Metasploit directory:

cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework
  
Once you are in the Metasploit directory, you can start the Metasploit console by running the following command:

*msfconsole
  
The Metasploit console is a text-based interface that provides access to all of the features of the Metasploit framework.

*Exploiting vulnerabilities

To exploit a vulnerability with Metasploit, you first need to load the exploit module for the vulnerability. You can do this by running the following command:

*use [exploit module name]
Once the exploit module is loaded, you can set the options for the exploit and then run it by running the following command:

exploit
If the exploit is successful, you will gain access to the target system.


Metasploit also provides a number of tools for automating tasks. For example, you can use the Metasploit console to automate the following tasks:

1.Scanning networks for vulnerabilities
2.Exploiting vulnerabilities
3.Gathering information from target systems
4.Performing post-exploitation activities
